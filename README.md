# Week 9 Project: Honeypot

Time Spent: 10 Hours 

## Writeup

 - To run this Honeypot I used the Modern Honey Network(MHN). Along with this, I used Google's cloud platform to provision the virtual machines used in this assignment. I basically followed the instructions on the course portal's website to setup my honeypot.
 - There were a lot of issues that I encountered while setting up the virtual machines(admin VM and honeypot VM). This was due to unclear instructions on the website.
 - I used the nmap command to see the attacks. It used tools like pcap, mssqld, etc. 

## Video Walkthrough

 - I could only capture so much before it stopped working for some reason. I could not figure out what went wrong. I am going to get this fixed as soon as possible and update the gif.
